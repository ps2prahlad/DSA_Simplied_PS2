start with visualising the graph,DSF,BFS and other problems 
remember few important points
DFS -> stack 
BFS -> queue

1. DFS => push into stack -> pop out of stack and print it -> get the neighbor -> iterate/recurve over neighbor's neighbor. Condition, graph should be acyclic.
2. For cyclclic Graph: use set to add visited nodes

/*
To determine if a given list of undirected edges forms a valid tree, you can use a graph traversal algorithm, such as depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS), and check for the following conditions:

1. The graph should be connected: Every node in the graph should be reachable from any other node. If there are any isolated nodes or disconnected components, it means the graph is not connected, and thus, not a valid tree.

2. The graph should have no cycles: If there is any cycle present in the graph, it violates the property of a tree since a tree is an acyclic graph. Therefore, if you encounter any back edges (edges that connect a node to one of its ancestors during the traversal), it means the graph has a cycle and is not a valid tree.

Here's an example implementation using a depth-first search (DFS) traversal to determine if the given edges form a valid tree:

```javascript

*/
function validTree(n, edges) {
  // Step 1: Build adjacency list representation of the graph
  const adjacencyList = Array.from({ length: n }, () => []);
  for (const [node1, node2] of edges) {
    adjacencyList[node1].push(node2);
    adjacencyList[node2].push(node1);
  }

  // Step 2: Perform DFS traversal to check connectivity and detect cycles
  const visited = Array(n).fill(false);
  if (hasCycle(adjacencyList, 0, -1, visited)) {
    return false; // Cycle detected, not a valid tree
  }

  // Step 3: Check if all nodes are visited (graph is connected)
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (!visited[i]) {
      return false; // Not all nodes are visited, not a valid tree
    }
  }

  return true; // Valid tree
}

function hasCycle(adjacencyList, node, parent, visited) {
  visited[node] = true;

  for (const neighbor of adjacencyList[node]) {
    if (!visited[neighbor]) {
      if (hasCycle(adjacencyList, neighbor, node, visited)) {
        return true; // Cycle detected
      }
    } else if (neighbor !== parent) {
      return true; // Back edge detected, cycle exists
    }
  }

  return false; // No cycle
}

```

In this implementation, the `validTree` function takes the number of nodes (`n`) and the list of undirected edges (`edges`) as input. It builds an adjacency list representation of the graph based on the edges.

Then, it performs a depth-first search (DFS) traversal starting from the first node (0) to check for connectivity and detect cycles. The `hasCycle` function is used in the DFS traversal to detect cycles by keeping track of visited nodes and checking for back edges.

If a cycle is detected during the DFS traversal, the function immediately returns `false`, indicating that the graph is not a valid tree. Otherwise, after the DFS traversal completes, the function checks if all nodes are visited. If any node is not visited, it means the graph is disconnected, and the function returns `false`.

If the graph is connected and has no cycles, the function returns `true`, indicating that the given edges form a valid tree.

Note that the implementation assumes that the input edges are valid and represent an undirected graph.

I hope this helps you determine if the given edges form a valid tree!
